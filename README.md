# IMDB Movies Annual Box Office Sales Summary -Dashboard

## Summary

This dashboard shows the summary status of over 2000 IMDB movies by box office gross revenue from US and Canada. It also contains information on the number of votes which reflects the popularity of the movie and also the average movie rating computed by IMDB based on viewer's response.  

Most of the data used was copied from data.world and mentioned to be screen scraped using jsonlite and XML libraries in R and an open API through OMDB from the IMDB website. Additional data were downloaded from IMDb Non-Commercial Datasets.

The data is about 7 years old which is why the year filter ends on 2017. A lot of effort is required to make sense of the data.
